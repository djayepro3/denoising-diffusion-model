 - Used variance-preserving kernel with noise schedules.
 - Designed and trained a Noise Prediction Network and visualized the diffusion and denoising processes.
 - Addressed mode collapse with a temperature parameter.

## Usage

To run the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/djayepro3/denoising-diffusion-model
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd denoising-diffusion-model
    ```
